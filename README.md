# Altius Hidden Solutions

Hide solutions to Altius practice exams

## Rational

While using Altius Test Prep to study for the MCAT, I decided to make these
extensions to assist with my studying. At the time I was enrolled in Altius
Test Prep, their practice exam material did not allow the user to hide the
answers while reviewing a test. I wanted to review my tests in a way that
helped me retrace my thinking before biasing myself to the either my previous
answer or from the given answer. So I created these extensions to toggle the
answers on and off.
